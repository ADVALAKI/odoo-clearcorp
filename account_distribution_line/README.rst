=========================
Account Distribution Line
=========================

This module is the base for distribution lines in Budget and Cash Flow report 
modules. It provides basic functions and attributes for both modules, and then, 
they implement their own functions: Budget Move Lines for Budget and Cash Flow 
Line for Cash Flow Report.

Also includes functions for Account Reconcile that are in common with both models.
